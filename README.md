This is the source code for a project completed as a part of a graduate-level course on Relational Database Management. Specifically, this projects concerns creating a SQL database and implementing several (5) stored procedures in PL/SQL that allow a user to interact with the database.

There is no UI as part of this project, as the focus is on creating the stored procedures.  

Three scripts:
1.  setup.sql => creates the database and inserts test data
2.	storedprocs.sql => create stored procedures to interact with the database based on requirements
3.	demo.sql => test each stored procedure and show changes in select query results as necessary
